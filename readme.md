> ### React-redux codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld-example-apps) spec and API.

I am aware of the existing [React + Redux Real World Example App](https://github.com/gothinkster/react-redux-realworld-example-app) but for educational purposes, to use a handsome composition of libraries but most importantly to follow a modular architecture with encapsulated modules as described in [Jack Hsu's excellent blog post](https://jaysoo.ca/2016/02/28/organizing-redux-application).

---

> ### Specs: [FRONTEND_INSTRUCTIONS](FRONTEND_INSTRUCTIONS.md)

Based on [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) (no-escape yet).

It uses the following library stack:
  * [React](https://facebook.github.io/react)
  * [Redux](http://redux.js.org)
  * [Immutable](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js)
  * [Reselect](https://github.com/reactjs/reselect)
  * [Redux-Saga](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga)
  * [Styled components](https://styled-components.com)
  * [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)
  * [Eslint](http://eslint.org)

The first iteration will be test-free. :smile:

In a second iteration I will add:
  * [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest) unit (and integration?) testing
  * [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io) end-to-end testing

In a third iteration I might add
  * [Flow](https://flow.org)

I might also experiment in using [redux-observable](https://redux-observable.js.org) instead of redux-saga.

Later I might also port this application to [Elm](http://elm-lang.org) and/or play with a Haskell backend.


### [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **React-redux** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **React-redux** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.
